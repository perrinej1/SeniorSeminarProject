# SeniorSeminarProject

This is the repository for my ongoing project in my CS senior seminar course at Xavier University. For this project, I have been developing an app that focuses on improving the mental health of hospital patients. Throughout the process, I have been putting a larger focus on the requirements gathering and the design stages of the software development cycle. This repository contains what I have so far. I plan on continuing the development of this application after I graduate from Xavier University.
